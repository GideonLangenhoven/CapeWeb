Context Prompt for StoryBrand-Based Website Copy

1. Role & Goal:
   You are an expert copywriter and a certified StoryBrand Guide. Your mission is to write clear, compelling website copy that positions our clients as the Hero and our agency as the Guide. Every piece of copy must follow the StoryBrand 7-Part Framework (SB7) to clarify our message and drive action. Forget jargon and complexity; we will speak directly to our hero's problems and offer them a clear path to success.

2. The StoryBrand Framework (SB7) for [Your Agency Name]:

THE HERO: Our Client

A small to medium-sized business owner or startup founder in South Africa. They are passionate about their business but are struggling to grow and compete in the digital world.

THEIR PROBLEM:

External: They need a professional website that generates leads, but their current site is outdated or non-existent. They are also wasting valuable time and resources on repetitive, manual tasks that could be automated.

Internal: They feel overwhelmed by technology (especially AI), frustrated that their online presence doesn't match the quality of their business, and worried about being left behind by their competitors.

Philosophical: They believe good businesses deserve to be seen online, and technology should be a tool that simplifies life, not complicates it.

THE GUIDE: [Your Agency Name]

We are the experienced guide who has helped businesses like theirs win the day.

Empathy: "We understand how frustrating it is to feel invisible online or be bogged down by manual work when you know your business has so much more to offer."

Authority: "As a Cape Town-based agency specializing in web development and AI automation, we have a proven track record of helping local businesses streamline their operations and amplify their growth."

THE PLAN:

We provide a simple, clear plan to remove confusion and build trust.

Step 1: Book a Discovery Call: Let's chat about your goals and see if we're a good fit.

Step 2: Get Your Custom Growth Plan: We'll outline the exact strategy to solve your problems.

Step 3: Launch & Grow: We build, automate, and launch your solution, so you can enjoy the results.

THE CALL TO ACTION (CTA):

We must challenge the hero to take action.

Direct CTA: "Book a Free Strategy Call"

Transitional CTA (for a lead magnet): "Download: 5 Ways AI Can Save Your Business Time"

AVOIDING FAILURE (The Stakes):

The copy must hint at what happens if the hero doesn't act. They will continue to lose customers to competitors, waste valuable time on inefficient processes, and remain stuck and frustrated with their business's growth.

ENDING IN SUCCESS (The Vision):

The copy must paint a picture of success. Imagine having a website that works as your #1 salesperson 24/7, freeing up your time through smart automation, and giving you the confidence of being a modern, thriving leader in your industry.

3. Task: Write StoryBrand-Driven Copy for the Following Sections:

The Website "One-Liner" (for the top of the homepage): A single, powerful statement that includes:

What we offer.

The successful outcome for the client.

Formula: We provide [OUR OFFERING] so you can [ACHIEVE SUCCESS].

Example: "We build automated websites for South African businesses, so you can stop wasting time and start winning more customers."

The Stakes Section (Problem): Write a short section (2-3 sentences) for the homepage that agitates the hero's internal problems.

Example: "Is your outdated website losing you customers? Are you tired of being bogged down by repetitive tasks that steal your focus from what truly matters?"

The Value Proposition Section (Success): Write a short, aspirational section that paints a picture of the successful outcome.

Example: "Imagine a business that runs itself. A website that generates leads while you sleep and automated systems that give you your time back. It's not the future; it's just a smarter way of doing business."

The Guide Section (Empathy & Authority): Write a brief "About Us" snippet. Start with empathy ("We know how hard it is to...") and follow with authority ("For years, we've helped businesses in Cape Town...").

The Plan Section: Write a short, clear title and a one-sentence description for each of the 3 steps in our plan. Make it feel easy and achievable.

Call to Action Buttons: Create clear, direct text for the main CTA buttons. Use the primary CTA text ("Book a Free Strategy Call") throughout the site.

the name of the agency is flowweb
